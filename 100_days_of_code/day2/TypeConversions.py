# note
# concatenation is only possible in string 
# not in int or others
# like

num_char = len(input("whats your name? "))
# print("Your Name has" + num_char + "characters" )  
# this will give u error


# ------------type function-------------

print(type(num_char))
# OUTPUT: <class 'int'>
# so it returns the type of the variable



# others things are discussed in Basics of Python file
